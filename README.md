# Text Classification with Various DNN Methods
While trying various DNN text classifier methods for a **Japanese corpus**, which is [**livedoor corpus**](https://www.rondhuit.com/download.html#ldcc),  I aim to gain some knowledge and experice of DNN for NLP.
<br>
## Tokenizer
I use [**MeCab**](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) + [**mecab-ipadic-neologd**](https://github.com/neologd/mecab-ipadic-neologd) for Japanese-word-tokenizer. Since the program is implemented in [Python](https://github.com/python), [**mecab-python3**](https://github.com/SamuraiT/mecab-python3) is also required to execute the program.
<br>
## word_embedding
For this investigation, **pretrained fastText embedding(Japanese)** is used, which can be found here [URL]https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByFQ96A4DgSPUm9wVWRLdm5qbmc.
